  title: QoD Provisioning API
  description: |
    The Quality-On-Demand (QoD) Provisioning API offers a programmable interface for developers to request the assignment of a certain QoS Profile to a certain device, indefinitely.

    This API sets up the configuration in the network so the requested QoS profile is applied to an specified device, at any time while the provisioning is available. The device traffic will be treated with a certain QoS profile by the network whenever the device is connected to the network, until the provisioning is revoked.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **QoS profiles and QoS profile labels**:
    Latency, throughput or priority requirements of the application mapped to relevant QoS profile values. The set of QoS Profiles that an operator is offering can be retrieved by means of the [QoS Profile API](link TBC).

    * **Identifier for the device**:
    At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the network operator for the device, at the request time. When multiple identifiers are provided, they must identify the same device. After the provisioning request is accepted, the device may get different IP addresses, but the provisioning will still apply to the device that was identified during the request process.between the device and the network.

    * **Notification URL and token**:
    Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications about all status change events (eg. provisioning termination) can be received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter.

    # Resources and Operations overview
    The API defines four operations:

    - An operation to setup a new QoD provisioning for a given device.
    - An operation to get the information about a specific QoD provisioning, identified by its `provisioningId`.
    - An operation to get the QoD provisioning for a given device.
    - An operation to terminate a QoD provisioning, identified by its `provisioningId`.


    ### Authorization and authentication

    CAMARA guidelines defines a set of authorization flows which can grant API clients access to the API functionality, as outlined in the document [CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/blob/main/documentation/CAMARA-API-access-and-user-consent.md). Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process, happening between the API Client and the Telco Operator exposing the API, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, while also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    It is important to remark that in cases where personal user data is processed by the API, and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of 3-legged access tokens becomes mandatory. This measure ensures that the API remains in strict compliance with user privacy preferences and regulatory obligations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric data control.

      summary: Sets a new provisioning of QoS for a device 
      description: |
        Triggers a new provisioning in the operator to assign certain QoS Profile to certain device.

        - If the provisioning is completed synchronously, the response will be 201 with `status` = `AVAILABLE`.
        - If the provisioning request is accepted but not yet completed, the response will be 201 with `status` = `REQUESTED`.
        - If the operator determines synchronously that the provisioning request cannot be fulfilled, the response will be 201 with `status` = `UNAVAILABLE`.

        - If the request includes a webhook, the client will receive a `status-changed` event with the outcome of the process. The event will be sent also for synchronous operations.

        NOTE: When the provisioning status becomes `UNAVAILABLE`, the QoD provisioning resource is not immediately released, but will get deleted automatically, at earliest 360 seconds after.
        This behavior allows clients which are not receiving notification events but are polling, to get the provisioning status information. Before a client can attempt to create a new QoD provisioning for the same device, they must release the provisioning resources with an explicit `delete` operation if not yet automatically deleted.

    StatusInfo:
      description: |
        Reason for the new `status`:
        * `NETWORK_TERMINATED` - Network terminated the QoD provisioning
        * `DELETE_REQUESTED`- User requested the deletion of the QoD provisioning

      type: string
      enum:
        - NETWORK_TERMINATED
        - DELETE_REQUESTED

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to the network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device
      type: object

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.
      type: string
      example: "123456789@domain.com"

    PhoneNumber:
      description: A public identifier addressing a telephone subscription. In mobile networks it corresponds to the MSISDN (Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number). In order to be globally unique it has to be formatted in international format, according to E.164 standard, prefixed with '+'.
      type: string
      pattern: '^\+[1-9][0-9]{4,14}$'
      example: "+123456789"

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
      properties:
        publicAddress:
          $ref: "#/components/schemas/SingleIpv4Addr"
        privateAddress:

      anyOf:
        - required: [publicAddress, privateAddress]
        - required: [publicAddress, publicPort]
      example:
        {
          "publicAddress": "203.0.113.0",
          "publicPort": 59765
        }

    SingleIpv4Addr:
      description: A single IPv4 address with no subnet mask
      type: string
      format: ipv4
      example: "203.0.113.0"

    DeviceIpv6Address:
      description: |
        The device should be identified by the observed IPv6 address, or by any single IPv6 address from within the subnet allocated to the device (e.g. adding ::0 to the /64 prefix).
      type: string
      format: ipv6
      example: 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7344

    Status:
      description: |
        The current status of the requested QoD provisioning. The status can be one of the following:
        * `REQUESTED` - QoD provisioning has been requested but is still being processed.
        * `AVAILABLE` - The requested QoS profile has been provisioned to the device, and is active.
        * `UNAVAILABLE` - The QoD provisioning request has been processed but is not active. `statusInfo` may provide additional information about the reason for the unavailability.
      enum:
        - REQUESTED
        - AVAILABLE
        - UNAVAILABLE
