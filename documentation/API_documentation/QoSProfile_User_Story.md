| **_Summary_**                 | As an application developer, I want to be able to query the list of available Quality of Service (QoS) profiles. I can then use use one of the Qos Profiles to start a Quality On Demand (QoD) session with a Communication Service Provider (CSP). The QoS profile contains information regarding network requirements for an application such as stable latency or throughput.                                                            |
| **_Roles, Actors and Scope_** | **Roles:** Customer:Developer<br><br>**Actors:** Application service providers, hyperscalers, application developers.<br><br>**Scope:** <ul><li>Retrieve a list of available QoS profiles (optionally filter by device)</li><li>Get details of a QoS Profile</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **_Pre-conditions_**          | The preconditions are listed below:<br><ol><li>Customer:Developer is eligible to use the QoS Profile API, i.e. the Customer has successfully subscribed to the QoS Profile API on the platform of an API Provider</li><li>The customer application has requested and received an access token for the required scopes of the API. Which specific authorization flows are to be used will be determined during onboarding process.</li></ol> |
| **_Activities/Steps_**        | **Starts when:** The customer application either makes a POST to retrieve the list of available QoS Profiles or a GET to see the individual details of a QoS Profile.<br><br>**Ends when:** When the user identifies the QoS Profile to use when creating a QoD session.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **_Post-conditions_**         | None - this is an immutable API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **_Exceptions_**              | Several exceptions might occur during the QoS Profile API operations<br>- Unauthorized: Not valid credentials (e.g. use of already expired access token).<br>- Invalid input: Not valid input data to invoke operation (e.g. IP address format not as expected).                                                                                                                                                                            |
